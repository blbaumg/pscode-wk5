// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

ask user to enter number
divide number entered by 2 
if there's a remainder print "Odd"
if there's not a remainder print "Even"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers. 
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

ask the user to enter five numbers one at a time, the first entered assigned as a, the second as b, third as c,fourth as d and the fifth as e

to calculate the average it would be (a+b+c+d+e)/5
print on screen the results along with the word "Average"

to find the smallest it would be if a < b,c,d,e then print "smallest"
to find the smallest it would be if b < a,c,d,e then print "smallest"
to find the smallest it would be if c < a,b,d,e then print "smallest"
to find the smallest it would be if d < a,b,c,e then print "smallest"
to find the smallest it would be if e < a,b,c,d then print "smallest"

to find the maximum of the five it would be if a > b,c,d,e then print "largest"
to find the maximum of the five it would be if b > a,c,d,e then print "largest"
to find the maximum of the five it would be if c > a.b,d,e then print "largest"
to find the maximum of the five it would be if d > a,b,c,e then print "largest"
to find the maximum of the five it would be if e > a,b,c,d then print "largest"
